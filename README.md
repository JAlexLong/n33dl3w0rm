# n33dl3w0rm

A personal exploration of developing malware while working through `Black Hat Python: Second Edition`

**n33dl3w0rm** is my first malware codebase, written in Python.

## Installation

1. Create a Python virtual environment

```sh
$ python -m venv ./venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $
```

2. Install n33dl3w0rm in editable mode

```sh
(venv) $ python -m pip install -e .
```

## Run the Project

```sh
(venv) $ n33dl3w0rm
Whatever the output will eventually be...
```

## Features

It's a bit drafty here right now...
